# Web Actions sample handler

**Author:** Matt Giuca <<mgiuca@chromium.org>>

This is a simple web-based text editor that registers as a Web Actions handler
for text files. It is designed to be used in conjunction with the app in the
`requester` directory.

The app requires a web browser with support for [Service
Workers](http://www.w3.org/TR/service-workers/) and [Arrow
functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions).
This includes newer versions of Google Chrome / Chromium and Mozilla Firefox.
(Tested on Chrome 46 and Firefox 42.)

## Usage instructions

See [requester/README.md](../requester/README.md).
